 * A client cannot tell a host that died from one that is briefly unreachable —
 * both look like a socket that will not open. So the reconnecting state never
 * claims the application has stopped. What it does do is change what it
 * *suggests* once a reconnect could no longer restore work in progress, which
 * is a fact the client does know: past the host's session retention window the
 * session has been reaped, so a reconnect starts fresh whatever happens.
